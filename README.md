## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to do the background adjustment to be as close as possible to the design. Size and position of the background needs to be adjusted first and then the next section will follow with a few adjustment.

### Continued development

I will continue to improve my layouting skill by making another page with another challenges.
